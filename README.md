# EDA_Tips_and_Tricks_Titanic
🧪 Tips and Tricks for Performing EDA Using Python

Prompt Overview
Task: Create a comprehensive guide on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.

Format: Use a Jupyter Notebook structure — combine markdown cells for explanations and code cells for implementation. The final output should be a standalone notebook file.

Content: Cover essential EDA components including:

Key Python libraries

Data cleaning techniques

Visualization methods

Best practices
Organize the guide around these four pillars of EDA:

📦 Data Composition

📊 Data Distribution

🔗 Data Relationships

⚖️ Data Comparison

Length: Ensure the guide is detailed enough to benefit both beginners and intermediate-level users.

Audience: Target data scientists, analysts, and learners interested in foundational EDA using Python.

Tone: Maintain a professional and educational tone, with occasional desi Pakistani-style language to keep it engaging and relatable.

Interpretability: All code should be well-commented, and explanations should clearly interpret the outputs — especially visualizations and statistical summaries.

Examples: Use practical datasets like sns.load_dataset('titanic') to demonstrate concepts effectively.

Visuals: Include visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. Add animated or interactive plots where applicable to enhance engagement.

References: Link to codanics.com and the Codanics YouTube channel for further learning resources on EDA and Python programming.

Output: Deliver one polished Jupyter Notebook file that can be downloaded and reused as a standalone EDA guide.
